# OpenGL Demo

"OpenGL Demo" is a demonstration of showing object with OpenGL.
The goal of this project is to show full image of object in OBJ file and to manipulate that object as you like.

# DEMO

You can see how the object can be shown with this software.
The movie below is just a prototype, showing the image without normal/texture data.

The next step is to include normal vectors and textures information !

# Features

This project only uses the OpenGL with fixed function pipeline, and ![GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw).

# Requirement

* GLFW(3.3.2)
* Xcode(11.5)

# Installation

Besides github, you can also install GLFW in ![this page](https://www.glfw.org).

# Usage

Please create an excecution directory, and posit "main.cpp" file and an "@@@.obj" file there.
Soon after you excecute the main.cpp program, you can put the object file name as demanded.
Then, the featureless object silhiouette should appear in front of your eyes !

# Note

I tested environments under Mac, not under Linux and Windows.
